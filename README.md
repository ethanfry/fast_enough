# fast_enough
Check your home interent speeds and propagate them to a central server

## Is your ISP fast enough for you?
Look, we're all paying for internet service. And usually it's not an issue, but who hasn't had their service drop?
Maybe it was just kind of annoying, like your movie paused. But maybe it was an important call for work, or maybe your team was in the playoffs, and BAM no service.
Fast Enough is a simple tool to monitor up/download speeds from your home network. It makes use of Speedtest's CLI tool, and uploads your data to AWS (if you like). There are even plans to shame your ISP on Twitter if your speeds drop below a given threshhold.

Come and join the fun!


# State of affairs
This is kind of working on a Raspberry Pi here at home. There are a lot of things that still need to be done. Rather than list all of those here, I'm just creating issues for them.
